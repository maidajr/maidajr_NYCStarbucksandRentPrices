Here's a map I made showing how there may be a correlation between rent prices in Manhattan Neighborhoods and the density of Starbucks coffee shops in the area. I pulled data from off the web using sources like github repositories containing Manhattan naighborhood geojsons and a blogpage of a guy who visited and plotted all of the Starbucks locations in NYC on a map. I found the average rent information for each neighborhood on www.rentcafe.cafe. I used Excel to visualize and further classify the rent data to create the classes you see on the finished map. Based off the results there seems to be a slight correlation between the two variables but there's obviously more factors that go into rent prices in NYC.
